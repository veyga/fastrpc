# examples
Example client-server interaction with a fastrpc generated library.

The server app (tynacorp) was built and tested using fastrpc.

The package was published to pypi, the client downloaded it, and interacted with it.

# TODO
docker-compose up

Rewrite the client to be some sort of flask app,
or something than can display HTML.
It should call the fastrpc server library
